# ðŸ”» What is Robotic Arm Manipulations?
<p align='justify'>Robotic arm manipulation involves the use of robotic arms to interact with the environment in a way that mimics the human hand's precision and versatility. This field encompasses algorithms for detection, grasping, and manipulation of objects, enabling robots to perform complex tasks such as picking, placing, assembling, and more. Key areas of focus include grip and grasp estimation, object recognition, and the seamless execution of tasks in varied and dynamic environments.</p> <hr> <br> <br>
